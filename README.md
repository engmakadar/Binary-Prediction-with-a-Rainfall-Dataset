# Binary-Prediction-with-a-Rainfall-Dataset

This project focuses on predicting whether it will rain on a given day using machine learning techniques. It is a binary classification problem, where the model predicts either Rain or No Rain based on weather and environmental features. The goal is to provide accurate and actionable rainfall forecasts to aid in planning and decision-making.


## Features
The model uses weather-related features such as:
Day: Day of the month
Pressure: Atmospheric pressure
Max Temperature: Maximum daily temperature
Humidity: Humidity percentage
Wind Speed: Average wind speed
Rainfall: Previous day or historical rainfall
Other environmental parameters relevant to precipitation

## Data
The dataset is collected from [source if applicable, e.g., government weather stations, Kaggle, etc.]

### Data preprocessing includes:
Handling missing values
Feature scaling
Removing highly correlated features
Train-test split


## Methodology
Data Preprocessing, Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
Scaling features and handling categorical variables if necessary.

### Model Training

Models used: XGBoost, LightGBM (or any other models you applied)
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for optimal performance

### Evaluation

Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
Confusion matrix to visualize correct vs. incorrect predictions
